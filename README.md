# WOSM mirror mount

This mirror holder is used by most WOSMs. It is a plastic part that allows a one-time alignment of the excitation dichroic mirror and the camera port mirror (100% broadband).
Adjustable-tension plastic springs hold the mirror in place.

## 3D printing recommendations:
This part is designed with filament deposition 3D printing in mind. No printing support structures are necessary.
PLA or ABS recommended. Z-step of 0.2mm or 0.1mm.

## Post processing:
If necessary clean up M3 and M4 threads with a tap. Take your time, going fast can overheat the plastic and kill the part.
Wash and dry this part before putting mirrors.
